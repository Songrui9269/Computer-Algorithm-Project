# Computer-Algorithm-Project
This project is about the computer algorithm optimization problem.

Part 1
Select either the single-source shortest path problem or the all-pairs shortest path problem.
Select two different algorithms to solve the problem you selected.
Given a random graph, write an algorithm that decides which shortest path algorithm to apply,
and then applies it. Explain the decisions you made in designing the algorithm.

Part 2
Write a program for implementing the algorithm you described in Part 1. This includes
implementations of the two algorithms you selected for the shortest path problem.
Run your program on randomly generated graphs of different sizes. You may bias the random
selections as needed to obtain graphs that are interesting to consider.
